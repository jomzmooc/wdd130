      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Good morning! I am Jomar. I am a student majoring in Applied Technology at BYU-Idaho, and I am seeking an opportunity to build your website. I have seen your Facebook page, “The Chill Trekker” organizing hiking activities and inviting people to join. Your Facebook page is wonderful, and it has all the details that joiners want to know. But I feel that having an interactive website would create excitement for your joiners as they easily navigate your page. Rather than scrolling up and down on your Facebook page, which I find a little bit indifferent. Having a website, joiners can experience the thrill of hiking as they navigate your website and view or watch fun-filled and exciting hiking activities that you had organized. We can also put future activities with pictures and the corresponding level of difficulty for them to choose which hiking activity they will join. With this kind of website, it will surely increase your joiners and ultimately your sales.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience of this site is for people looking for adventure in mountain hiking in the Philippines. This site will provide much needed information regarding mountains to hike, level of difficulty, sample etinerary, and lastly to meet new people with same interest. More specifically, this site will provide informations for beginners, young and old, who want to try hiking. For interimidiate hikers, who want to level up their experience and to experienced hikers who want to conquer another mountains.</p>  <!-- change this -->
