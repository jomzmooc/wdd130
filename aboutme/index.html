      <p>Hi everyone! I am super excited to be in this class and to know and work with everyone. 
        My friends call me Jomz, I am married and have two kids. My wife's name is Jeck Mary and my two children names are Nimrod Jeck and Naomi Jeck. I'm sure everyone would know who gave their names q:-)</p>
      <p>By the way, I am from the Philippines. When pandemic started early 2020, we've come to love hiking. The picture above was taken recently at Rangyas Peak (883 MASL) Mt. Batolusong. For the past two years we were able to hike 4 mountains.</p=>
      <p>Currently, I am working full time and serving as a bishop.</p>
      <p>Nice to meet you all</p>
